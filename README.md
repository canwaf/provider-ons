# Data reposititory for demonstration qube transformations of multidimensional data
This repository exists to demonstrate transforms in pandas to show how multidimensional data can be represented in a cube without loss of information, and although this is the aim these transforms are not complete representations of the multi-worksheet Excels they seek to replace. 

## Public Service Producitivity
The public service producitivity dataset represents the Excel file found within the qube-config json file's source keyword's value. It is comprised of three cube components for transformation. There is currently no notes included which are required to signify the data correctly. Such notes are important and will be added in a future update, namely the series break of 2020 due to covid, and how input=output in several measured sectors.
